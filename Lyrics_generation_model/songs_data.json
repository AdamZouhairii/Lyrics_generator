        "lyrics": "20. \nBetter Off Dead\n - Flatbush Zombies\nThe entirety of Flatbush Zombies\u2019 sophomore effort \nBetterOffDEAD\n can be summed up by one track: \n\u201cDeath 2\u201d.\n It represents a manifesto of sorts for the trio, \nsplattering a terrifying sample of an interview with Charles Manson and some violently drugged-out lyrics\n onto \nproducer\n \nErick Arc Elliot\u2019s trademark grim landscape.\n On the surface, the Zombies have barely progressed from being the intentionally-insane jack-of-all-drugs zombie-obsessed members of the burgeoning hip-hop force the Beast Coast. However, once you enter into their world on \nBetterOffDEAD\n, they quickly whisk you away into a hazy realm of ethereal beats, harshly smooth flows, and a plethora of topics the two MCs trade bars on. Released on 9/11/13 at 9:11 P.M., \nthe political content immediately struck as more evolved and polished.\n The 19 tracks seem to warp into a continuous stream that allows each song to stand out on its own while not deviating from the general concept of the tape. In this sense alone, the group reveals a massive amount of \nmusical growth since their eccentric debut mixtape \nD.R.U.G.S.\n.\n19. \nThe Gifted\n - Wale\nA Wale album wouldn\u2019t be a Wale album without criticism, controversy, and, well, haters. \nAbout six months after dropping \nFolarin\n, Wale blessed us with \nhis\n third studio album entitled, \nThe Gifted\n. The album had already received reproach when the artwork for the \nalbum cover\n dropped, but \nWale had a response for the nonbelievers\n. \nThe Gifted\n is a classic \u201cDMV-style\u201d record with stories that touch on drugs, sex, and growing up in an environment with a \u201ccrabs in the bucket\u201d mentality. It contains music as diverse as its features with club bangers like \u201cClappers\u201d to more profound songs like \n\u201cBlack Heroes\u201d\n. The musicality of the records make it clear that Wale\u2019s focus was on big production this time around. \nWale might feel he didn\u2019t get proper recognition\n, but the RG community certainly was feeling him!\n18. \nTherapy\n - Tech N9ne\nTherapy\n is an EP with 11 tracks, 4 of which are skits, but as Tech N9ne assures you early on, it is not something he threw together and put out carelessly. Instead, the EP has a very distinct feel, with Tech spitting and doing a bit of singing over what amounts to \nrock\n and roll tracks produced by Ross Robinson and Seven. Tech tackles a range of emotions with topics like the failings of the school system to relationship issues. When paired with the unorthodox production, it is strangely effective in getting its message across. By the end of \nTherapy\n, most listeners are going to be wishing the EP was longer\n17. \nRun The Jewels\n - El-P & Killer Mike\nEl-P and Killer Mike both dropped extremely dope albums in 2012,\n so when they decided to come together as Run the Jewels, and release an album this year, \neveryone was rubbing their hands together like Birdman.\n El-P\u2019\ns\n trademark production lays the framework for the two rappers to go off, and they do, \nspitting with the intent to outdo each other and everyone else in rap on each song.\n The result is an album that doesn\u2019t mess around with fancy hooks or excessive features. Instead, it\u2019s rappers simply rapping, and doing so extremely well.  Did I mention they released this album for free?\n16. \nKnock Madness\n - Hopsin\nOver 3 years after his first independently-released album \nRaw\n, Hopsin presents us with another indie release \nKnock Madness\n. The album featurs fellow \nFunk Volume\n members including \nSwizZz\n, \nJarren Benton\n, and \nDizzy Wright\n, \nalong with fellow independent artist and Strange Music Mogul Tech N9ne.\n \nWhat\u2019s more is production was handled \nentirely\n by Hopsin himself.\n \nMomentum for the album was fueled by aggressive releases like \u201cHop Is Back\u201d.\n During the weeks leading up to the release date for the album, Hopsin appeared to go through a rough patch with all the pressure of releasing another album and touring at the same time, leading to \nsomewhat of a breakdown via his twitter.\n However, Hopsin bounced back, \nreleased the album on November 24th\n, and \nreceived fairly positive reviews. #StillMovin\u2019\n15. \nSummer Knights\n - Joey Bada$$\nSummer Knights\n is the follow-up to Joey Badass\u2019 acclaimed debut mixtape, \n1999\n.  The tape featurs his fellow Pro Era members and boasts strong production from DJ Premier, The Alchemist, and MF Doom.  \nMuch like \n1999\n, the tape exudes a \u201890s feel. However, \nSummer Knights\n carries a much darker tone, perhaps because of the passing of Joey's close friend, \nCapital STEEZ\n (\nwho is honored on the penultimate track, \u201c#LongLiveSteelo\u201d\n). The tape had several standout tracks, \nincluding his debut single, \u201cUnorthodox\u201d, which was laden with wordplay\n. Overall, Joey produced another solid mixtape effort, solidifying himself as one of hip-hop\u2019s most promising MCs\n14. \nLONG.LIVE.A$AP\n - A$AP Rocky\nDropping at the top of the year is always a risk; you never know what\u2019s coming, who\u2019s coming, or how your major label debut is going to hold up against the competition. \nHowever, for Lord Flacco, that ain\u2019t a problem\n. \nLeaking a full month before the release date saw the industry condemn Rocky\u2019s album to poor sales, yet to much surprise, he moved 139,000 units in the first week.\n \nThe LP spawned multiple hits\n, \nmost notably the Drake, 2 Chainz, and Kendrick assisted \n\u201dFuckin\u2019 Problems\u201d\n, \nearning Rocky 2x platinum status\n \nand almost 5 million views on Rap Genius\n. \nThe other most notable song \n\u201d1 Train\u201d\n featured a host of young MC\u2019s, with the cypher starting the 6 minute song trend of 2013.\n  Long.Live.A$AP functioned as necessary: it spawned multiple hits, presented Rocky to the masses, \nand cemented the ASAP Mob as New York\u2019s newest clique to watch in the coming years\n13. \nInnanetape\n - Vic Mensa\nINNANETAPE\n is a trip through your emotions guided by a narrator who seems to be mature beyond his years. \nFrom infectiously feel-good songs like \"Orange Soda\"\n \nand \"Lovely Day\"\n to introspective and serious ones like \n\"Holy, Holy\"\n and \n\"Fear & Doubt,\"\n Vic is always honest in detailing his observations and experiences. \nHe hops on and off the beat at will\n, effortlessly delivering bars from the humorously playful to the intensely sobering. Vic\u2019s nimble performance is underscored \nby production ably spearheaded by the likes of Cam\n, Peter Cottontale, and Vic himself\n12. \nOld\n - Danny Brown\nThey want that old Danny Brown.\n \nXXX\n was a complicated, dark album about life in Detroit where Danny Brown\u2019s voice and frame of mind could change wildly depending on the song. There was also a bunch of sex and drugs. \nOld\n, its follow up, grapples with the success and misconceptions of \nXXX\n--\u201d\nThe return of the gangster/ fuck a hipster squeeze a trigger/You got me fucked up I'm a hood ass nigga.\u201d\n \nOld\n front loads songs about drug addiction and poverty on Side A, while saving the festival ready bangers for Side B. It's an interesting conceptual approach that rewards multiple listens, \nwhether your favorite track is the gritty \u201c25 Bucks\u201d\n or \nthe druggy, energetic \u201cDip.\u201d\n Danny Brown has matured in a way that gives his music layers while not compromising his unmistakable pace, personality and provocation\n11. \nMagna Carta Holy Grail\n - Jay Z\nOn 2011\u2019s \nWatch the Throne\n, Jay Z set out to ask a very serious question, and one that he was uniquely well-equipped to weigh in on:\n \nwhat does it mean to finally have a black elite class in America, given the country\u2019s long and sordid history of white supremacy, and of black resistance?\n  While \nWTT\n attempted to delve into that question on a macro level, this year\u2019s \nMagna Carta Holy Grail\n looked at the same issues, but from a micro, personal perspective\nThe album\u2019s repeated evocations of Ali are telling.  As with The Champ, Jay no longer has the option of going out in a blaze of glory like his pal Chris Wallace, whose epic public funeral he evokes on \u201cF.U.T.W.\u201d\n  Instead, he\u2019s determined to set up a legacy -- to turn the \n\u201cnew blacks with new stacks\u201d\n into a lasting societal force.  And if he\u2019s as successful with that as he was this year in talking about it, we\u2019ll be in pretty good shape. #FactsOnly\n10. \nWolf\n - Tyler the Creator\nTyler told us \nWolf\n was coming all the way back in 2010 and on April 2nd, the OF general unleashed his 3rd full length body of work, \ncomplete with 3 album covers\n, \nsocks\n, and a track with his idol Pharrell. Presenting a heavy conceptual storyline set in Camp \nFlog Gnaw\n, the album takes you through the trials and tribulations of the main characters: Tyler, Wolf, Sam, and Salem, weaving intricately between the narratives we\u2019ve heard on his albums prior. Serving as a prequel to those projects, \nWolf\n  is not only a conceptual masterpiece, but an evolution of Tyler\u2019s music. The production took an alternate direction and featured a different set of sonics. \nWith heavy influence from The Neptunes, Tyler crafts around the drums like a seasoned vet.\n \nStandout tracks include \u201cIFHY\u201d, \u201cTreehome95\u201d, \u201c48\u201d, and \u201cRusty\u201d, and with dope features from his Odd Future brethren, \n\u201cWolf\u201d\n was one of the years best.\n  The album, story and sonics resonate despite a dozen releases that came after it, and luckily we still have a movie to look forward to\n9. \nWatching Movies With The Sound Off\n - Mac Miller\nWatching Movies with the Sound Off\n affords the listener a rare glimpse into the maturation process of both a man and an artist.\n Mac's exploration of different philosophies and perspectives is expressed through denser rhyme schemes and more diversified features than ever before. The introspection on tracks like \n\"REMember\"\n and \"Objects in the Mirror\" evokes emotion from the audience, \nwhile the dichotomy of playfulness and surrealism on tracks like \"Avian\" effectively captures the album's essence as a whole.\n The album's airy production matches Mac's experimental tone, packaging his best release to date\n8. \nBorn Sinner\n - J.Cole\nThis album is light years ahead of \nJ. Cole\u2019s previous album release, 2010\u2019s \nCole World\n,\n and shows a unique style and voice that wasn\u2019t there before.This album may be just enough to liberate Cole from the stigma of being \u201cDiet Drizzy\u201d as music reviewer BigGhost once called him, because it also has a diversity in tone, from morose confessional tracks like \n\u201cLet Nas Down\u201d\n to \nR&B rave-ups like \u201cPower Trip\u201d,\n which was assisted in part by another up and comer, Miguel. \nCole finally came out from under the shadow of Jay Z\n and \n\u201cWork Out\u201d,\n to deliver a solid album\n7. \nDoris\n - Earl Sweatshirt\nEarl Sweatshirt came through looking extra clean with the release of \nDoris\n in August of this year. Thebe\u2019s album debuted at number 5 on the Billboard 200 with 49,000 sales in the US. \nWith that fuckin\u2019 flow that so belittles men\n, it\u2019s understandable that this album got a ton of love on Rap \nGenius\n. \nDoris\n has over 2.6 million combined pageviews, most of which are on standout tracks \n\u201cHive\u201d,\n \n\u201cChum\u201d,\n and \n\u201cWhoa\u201d.\n The album includes production from RZA, The Neptunes, and Tyler the Creator. Technically and sonically this album is truly a masterpiece; \nEarl killed them all with this one\n6. \nMy Name Is My Name\n - Pusha T\nAfter the countless rumors and delays, the hip-hop world was questioning if Terrance Thronton could really compete with the major players minus older brother Gene.\n King Push put the gossip to rest on October 7 when the 36 year old released his highly anticipated debut solo project; \nMy Name Is My Name\n. \nWithout an ideal rollout, Push relied on the streets and Internet to hype the record.\n Raw, dark and sometimes described as \u201cdisgusting\u201d records hit the hood; \n\u201dNumbers On The Boards\u201d, \u201cNosetaliga\u201d and \u201cSuicide\u201d\n were 2013\u2019s ghetto anthems. \nThe G.O.O.D Music golden child was also popular on Rap Genius, with 2 songs featuring in the top 10 of our best 100 songs as well as managing to find a spot on our MVP list; taking the #10 spot.\n \nMy Name Is My Name\n captured the essence of hip hop with it\u2019s standout production and menacing wordplay - will it go down as a classic debut? Only time will tell\n5. \nNothing Was The Same\n - Drake\nDrizzy shook up the rap game when he dropped one of the most anticipated albums of the year, \nNothing Was The Same\n, the follow up of his \nhighly successful sophomore LP, \nTake Care\n.\n The album featured \nJay Z,\n \nJhen\u00e9 Aiko,\n \n2 Chainz,\n \nand others.\n \nProduction was mainly handled by his right-hand man, Noah \"40\" Shebib,\n with help from additional OVO sound producers. Propelled by the successes of the smash singles \n\u201cStarted From The Bottom\u201d\n and \n\u201cHold On, We're Going Home\u201d,\n Drake debuted #1 on the US Billboard 200 chart, moving an impressive 658,000 units in the first week and was certified platinum just one month after its release. With over a combined \n15.6 MILLION\n pageviews on Rap Genius, it's clear \nNWTS\n was one of the most popular and acclaimed albums of 2013\n4. \nBecause The Internet\n - Childish Gambino\nIt seems ludicrous that anyone would give up the relative security of a TV paycheck\n \nto perfect and promote their musical projects (amongst other things)\n. Yet that is what Childish Gambino did, and his sacrifice bore great fruit in \nBecause the Internet\n. The album showcases greatly improved hooks and flow whilst maintaining the stellar production of the D-\nMoney\n/\nLudwig G\u00f6rransson team\n (who BTW doesn\u2019t feel the need to stick his name alongside Gambino\u2019s). This LP expands on many of the themes Gambino has previously addressed: \nemotionally dissatisfying relationships\n, questions of identity/authenticity; but they\u2019re framed within the new contexts of his life, namely the technologies (the internet and other new media) that have arguably propelled him to musical stardom. \nTo that end he wrote an 76-page screenplay\n \nand filmed a 25-minute prequel short (\nClapping for the Wrong Reasons\n) and uploaded them to the web to accompany the album\n. People might still argue that Gambino\u2019s lyrics aren\u2019t \u201cserious\u201d enough, but no one can argue that he doesn\u2019t take his work seriously, and it shows\n3. \nMarshall Mathers LP 2\n - Eminem\nThere was a lot riding on this album. A flop would transform Em from a \nrespected veteran\n to a \n41-year-old sellout that still has to dye his hair blond to move records.\n Not to mention the fact that its title would draw natural comparisons to the original \nMarshall Mathers LP\n, one of the most \nbrilliant\n, \nsuccessful\n, and \ncontroversial\n albums of all time. Luckily, instead of trying to recreate the original, Em simply revisited it. The themes of the two are still similar: \nfamily issues\n, \ntrouble dealing with fame\n, and \nthe difference between his alter-egos\n. But the sequel \nshowed sides of Em that we\u2019ve never seen\n and did enough to differentiate itself from the original to merit its title. \nCritics praised it as his best work since \nThe Eminem Show\n, and standout tracks like \n\u201cBad Guy\u201d\n and \n\u201cRap God\u201d\n prove that the \nKing of Controversy\n \nstill has plenty to say\n2. \nAcid Rap\n - Chance the Rapper\nAcid Rap\n finds Chance coming into his own lane and gaining a huge audience for it. He is high-energy and on the ball from the very start, only slowing down to \nvividly paint a picture of Chicago gun violence\n and \nremind us what love is.\n Despite categorically bomb features from the likes of \nBronsolino,\n \nSoulo,\n \nGambino,\n \nTwista, and Vic Mensa,\n Chance\u2019s now-signature sportive flow holds the attention of the listener throughout the whole mixtape. \nThis set of songs effectively blurs the line between mixtape and album,\n \nand has led Chance across the country\n and \nonto the cover of multiple magazines\n1. \nYeezus\n - Kanye West\nKanye\u2019s 6th solo album,\n \nYeezus\n, stunned many due to Ye\u2019s all-around unique creation and promotion of the project. \nThe whole concept around this creative masterpiece was minimalism\n, and Kanye definitely hit the nail on the head, starting with the promotion of the album. \nThe only big promotional tools used by Ye were posters\n \nand the infamous projections of the 4th song on the album, \u201cNew Slaves.\u201d\n Other than these two methods, \nthere was not much outside promotion\n to really put a light on the potentially culture-changing album delivered in \nYeezus.\n Speaking of minimalism, Ye really took it to the next level, by only releasing 10 songs and having Rick Rubin come in to minimize (yes, \nMINIMIZE\n) the album\nContent-wise, the 10 tracks that were presented were all so, so, sooooo good. \nBeginning with the bombastic and Earth-shattering \u201cOn Sight\u201d,\n Kanye truly proved that he \n\u201cdoes not give a fuck\u201d\n and is willing to do whatever in order to make sure that he gets the best sound possible. That best sound? \nIt ranges from the soulful flashback that is \u201cBound 2\u201d\n to the banging \u201cBlood on the Leaves\u201d to the outstandingly synthesized \u201cI Am a God.\u201d In addition to the production, which was handled by a \nterrific team of producers\n, Kanye lyrically brings a lot to the table, \nrapping about everything from Hedi Slimane\n to metaphorical religious journeys up mountains \nto having sex with Kim Kardashian\nIn all, the process, creation, and content delivered in \nYeezus\n was revolutionary in multiple aspects. It's no wonder it made the #1 spot on our list of top 20 rap albums!",
